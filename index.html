<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How can I participate in a sponsored game?</strong></p>

<p>To participate in a sponsored game, you must first click on the game before the countdown ends and enter the draw. The system will conduct a draw at the end of the countdown, and two lucky participants will be selected to play the game.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How to play?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The game can be played in 4 different ways:</p>

	<li>Create a new game by specifying the amount of tokens you want to play with.</li>
	<li>Join an existing game opened by other players.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How can I create a new game?</strong></p>

The decision to limit the number of requests for sponsored games is a measure we have taken to prevent malicious participants from sending multiple requests to increase their chances. We take and will continue to take all necessary precautions to protect honest participants.</p>
